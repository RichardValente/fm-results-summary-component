## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is my first project without help or course going step by step.
I'm happy to have managed to get very close to the proposal of the challenge.
I learned a lot about how tags work, how they assume their positions with the use of the grid by CSS.


### Continued development

In the future, when learning how to use JavaScript I plan to re-code this site adding the part to enter the data and show the result with the specific text for each group of scores.

### Useful resources

I used these two websites to help understand some functions and solve doubts.
